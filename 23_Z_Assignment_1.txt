Your supermarket company is working on expanding their Docker infrastructure. They have an existing service that provides a list of fruit sold in their stores. After measuring the amount of load on this service, they have asked you to scale this service up to a higher number of replicas.

In addition, there is a new service that provides a list of vegetables. This new service needs to be created in the cluster. Set up the swarm cluster to complete the lab, ensure that the swarm meets the following specifications:

1. Scale the service called products-fruit to 5 replicas.
2. Create a new service called products-vegetables running the linuxacademycontent/vegetable-service:1.0.0 image.
3. Publish products-vegetables on port 8081. The application listens on port 80.
4. Run products-vegetables with 3 replicas.

You can test the products-fruit service from any swarm node (including the manager) with curl localhost:8080.

Once products-vegetables is running, you should be able to test it from any swarm node (including the manager) with curl localhost:8081.

Good luck!

 Scale the service called products-fruit to 5 replicas.
 ===========================
 
 Login to Manager host and initialize the swarm 
 
 docker swarm init --advertise-addr ManagerIP
 
 Now, SSH to the worker-01 node and run the below command to join swarm (Manager)
 
 root@swarm-01:~# docker swarm join \
> --token SWMTKN-1-51pzs5ax8dmp3h0ic72m9wq9vtagevp1ncrgik115qwo058ie6-3fokbd3onl2i8r7dowtlwh7kb \
> 10.0.0.1:2377

 From Manager machine run below command to create the service:
 ===================
 
 root@manager:~# docker service create --replicas 2 -p 80:80 --name products-fruit nginx
 
 TO scale the service:
 ==========
 docker service scale products-fruit=5 
 
 Repeat the above joining command to add worker-02 node:
 Run the below command from manager machine to create another service:
 ====================
 
 root@manager:~# docker service create --replicas 3 -p 8081:80 --name products-vegetables linuxacademycontent/vegetable-service:1.0.0
